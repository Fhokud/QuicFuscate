# Contributing to QuicFuscate

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document explains how to set up your environment, the development workflow, coding standards, and how to submit high-quality pull requests that fit the project's architecture and quality bar.

QuicFuscate is a monolithic Rust crate with a small, carefully curated `scripts/` toolchain. Documentation is centralized in `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` and must remain the single source of truth.

## Project Architecture
- Single crate under `src/`
  - `src/core.rs` - QUIC session and I/O core
  - `src/crypto/` - AEAD, cipher, key exchange glue (mod.rs + aegis, aes, chacha, morus, hkdf)
  - `src/fec/` - FEC (encoder/decoder/adaptive/GF tables, mod.rs + internal, gf_tables, fountain_codes, etc.)
  - `src/stealth/` - DoH, HTTP/3 masquerading, TLS Cover, fingerprinting, domain fronting, QPACK helpers (mod.rs + tls_cover)
  - TLS fingerprints: deterministic in-memory ClientHello synthesis in `src/stealth/` (no on-disk profiles required). Optional external base64 dumps under top-level `browser_profiles/` are used by the TLS utility scripts for auditing only.
- Script workflow
  - Consolidated build/test/audit/bench scripts under `scripts/{build,benchmarks,tests,utils}/`
  - Audit entrypoints are under `scripts/tests/audits/`
- Documentation (English only)
  - `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` - single file of truth
  - `docs/changelog.md` - change log (add new entries at the top; do not rewrite old entries)

The design favors consolidation into well-organized module directories (`src/fec/`, `src/crypto/`, `src/stealth/`, `src/optimize/`, `src/transport/`). Each directory has a `mod.rs` root with focused sub-modules. Do not duplicate logic across modules or introduce parallel implementations.


## Getting Started
Prerequisites:
- Rust 1.93.0 stable (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- Git, Bash
- bun (for frontend apps under `apps/` and shared packages under `packages/`)
- python3 (required by some scripts, for example `scripts/tests/suites/test-e2e-admin-web.sh`)

Bootstrap build & verify via scripts:
```bash
./scripts/tests/build/build-check.sh
./scripts/tests/utils/util-run-full-suite.sh
./scripts/tests/audits/audit-all-comprehensive.sh
```
Build the crate:
```bash
cargo build
```


## Local Build & Tests
- Build: `cargo build` (use `--release` only for final deployment builds)
- Tests: `cargo test --features rust-tests`
- Lints: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Crypto suite: `./scripts/tests/suites/test-crypto.sh`
- Static hardening audit: run via `./scripts/tests/audits/audit-all-comprehensive.sh`

If a workflow fails, check `scripts/out/` for logs/reports and re-run the appropriate script.

## Modular Script Architecture
A modular script architecture is provided to streamline common developer tasks (build/test helpers and E2E TLS checks). Dedicated scripts are organized in purpose-specific directories:

- **Build Scripts**: `scripts/tests/build/` directory contains build-related scripts
- **Test Scripts**: `scripts/tests/` directory contains testing workflows
- **Audit Scripts**: `scripts/tests/audits/` directory contains security and quality audits
- **Benchmark Scripts**: `scripts/benchmarks/` directory contains performance testing
- **Utility Scripts**: `scripts/tests/utils/` directory contains helper utilities

```bash
# Build workflows:
./scripts/build/build-pgo-release.sh
./scripts/tests/build/build-check.sh

# Test workflows:
./scripts/tests/utils/util-run-full-suite.sh
./scripts/tests/suites/test-crypto.sh

# Audit workflows:
./scripts/tests/audits/audit-all-comprehensive.sh
```

For E2E TLS operations you can use:
- `./scripts/tests/utils/util-e2e-decode-all-profiles.sh` - decode ALL profiles
- `./scripts/tests/utils/util-e2e-verify-current.sh` - verify current profile (requires .sha256)
- `./scripts/tests/utils/util-e2e-verify-all.sh` - verify ALL profiles (requires .sha256)
- `./scripts/tests/utils/util-tls-generate-sha256-sidecars.sh` - generate .sha256 sidecars

Note: The modular script architecture provides direct CLI access to all operations. CI and docs are aligned to this script-based approach.


## Quality Gates (must pass)
Before opening a PR, all of the following must be true:
- No panics or stubs in runtime code: no `unwrap/expect/panic!/todo!/unimplemented!`
- No debug prints in runtime code: no `dbg!/println!/eprintln!`
- Proper error handling and logging (`log` macros) with actionable messages
- `cargo test --features rust-tests` clean
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean
- Crypto suite: `./scripts/tests/suites/test-crypto.sh`
- Static hardening audit: run via `./scripts/tests/audits/audit-all-comprehensive.sh`
- CI builds on Linux/macOS/Windows (GitHub Actions)


## Coding Standards
- Rust 2021 edition
- Prefer explicit error types or `anyhow` at boundaries; avoid silent failures
- Never `unwrap/expect` in runtime paths; use `?` and map errors with context
- Panics allowed only in tests and clearly unreachable code paths
- Logging: use `trace/debug/info/warn/error` consistently; no ad-hoc prints
- Public APIs must be documented; keep examples minimal and correct
- Performance-sensitive code paths should include rationale in comments


## Module Boundaries & Layout
- Keep the FEC logic consolidated in `src/fec/`. New submodules only when extracting large inline blocks
- Stealth functionality belongs in `src/stealth/` (DoH, TLS Cover, HTTP/3 masquerading, domain fronting, QPACK)
- QUIC stream/session internals stay in `src/core.rs`
- TLS fingerprint handling belongs to `src/stealth/` (in-memory generation + caching)

When adding new functionality, integrate with the closest primary module. Avoid duplicative helpers; prefer cohesive, well-named internal functions.


## Frontend Development

The Svelte 5 frontends and shared packages use Bun as package manager and runtime:

- **Web Admin**: `cd apps/svelte-admin && bun install && bun run dev --port 1430`
- **Desktop**: `cd apps/svelte-desktop && bun install && bun run dev`
- **Shared UI**: `packages/ui` (Svelte 5 components), `packages/theme` (CSS tokens)

Quality gates (run before PRs):
- `bun run check` - Svelte/TS type checking per app
- `bun run test:unit` - Vitest unit tests per app (test files live under `scripts/tests/frontend/`)
- E2E: `bunx playwright test` via configs in `apps/svelte-admin/playwright.config.ts` and `apps/svelte-desktop/playwright.config.ts`

Component conventions:
- One component per `.svelte` file, PascalCase naming
- Shared presentational components go in `packages/ui/`
- App-specific components in `apps/<app>/src/lib/components/`
- Tests mirror source structure under `scripts/tests/frontend/<app>/unit/`


## Stealth Profiles & Fingerprints
- Runtime fingerprinting uses deterministic in-memory ClientHello synthesis (no on-disk profiles required).
- If you maintain external base64 dumps (`.chlo`/`.chlo.b64`) for auditing, place them under top-level `browser_profiles/` and use the TLS utility scripts to decode/verify and generate sidecars.
- Use the CLI to list available fingerprints and verify selection
- Ensure TLS Cover and real TLS fingerprint modes remain consistent with the profile set


## Configuration & Docs
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` is the single source of truth. Update it for any user-facing change:
  - CLI flags, environment variables (`QUICFUSCATE_*`), configuration keys
  - Stealth behavior, profile storage paths, defaults
- Keep `docs/changelog.md` up to date (prepend newest section). Summarize what changed and why
- Keep `README.md` concise; link to `DOCUMENTATION.md` for deep detail
- Always update `config/quicfuscate.toml` when adding/removing config keys


## Commit Messages & Branches
- Branch naming: `feature/<short>`, `fix/<short>`, `docs/<short>`, `refactor/<short>`
- Conventional style is appreciated: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `perf: ...`, `test: ...`, `ci: ...`
- Make logical, small commits; keep messages imperative and focused
